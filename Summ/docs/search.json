    "text": "3. Data Transformation and Cleaning\nThe raw data underwent several cleaning and transformation steps: - Stock Data: Missing values in the stock dataset were handled, and the “Date” column was converted to datetime format. Percent changes in stock prices were computed, and extreme movements (spikes or dips) were flagged. - Earnings Call Data: Missing transcripts were replaced with empty strings. Named Entity Recognition (NER) was applied to identify key entities like “Apple”, “5G”, and “AI” from the earnings call text. - Earthquake Data: Data was filtered to include only earthquakes with a magnitude greater than or equal to 5.5 and relevant location information was extracted. - NER Data: After applying spaCy’s NER model, the data was enriched with entity extraction from the transcripts, marking important terms such as company names, monetary values, and products. Additionally, custom word filtering was applied from the Bing News articles, with specific keywords such as “earthquake” and “magnitude” being manually added to enhance entity recognition for relevant events. This was done to capture additional entities that could impact the analysis, such as natural disasters and related quantifiers."

    "text": "6. Summary Statistics\n\n\n\nImpact of Earthquakes on Supply Chain Resilience in TSMC Semiconductor Industry\n\n\n\nStock Data:\n\nThe average quarterly stock price change for TSMC shows a significant volatility influenced by both TSMC’s earnings reports and earthquake events.\nThe largest dips in stock prices correlate strongly with earthquake events:\n\n2023-Q1 saw a -13.0% drop in stock price, which coincided with a major earthquake (M6.5) in the region, likely impacting semiconductor production and supply chains.\n2022-Q2 also experienced a -13.0% dip, potentially influenced by multiple factors including supply chain disruptions due to natural disasters and global semiconductor shortages, alongside other macroeconomic pressures.\n2024-Q1 showed a -15.7% dip, which was directly associated with an M6.1 earthquake that affected TSMC’s wafer production capacity, with estimates indicating 20,000 wafers could have been impacted by the earthquake.\n\nSignificant Rises:\n\nOn the other hand, 2020-Q3 saw an impressive +35.2% rise in stock price following a TSMC earnings call on the successful release of its N5 process technology, showing how company-specific factors also drive stock performance.\n\n\nEarthquake Impact:\n\nEarthquake events with magnitudes ≥ 5.5 had noticeable correlations with TSMC stock price dips. For example, in 2023-Q1, a magnitude 6.2 earthquake caused a +9.1% rise, likely attributed to recovery or positive sentiment surrounding post-earthquake rebuilding or operational continuity.\nThe largest earthquake-related dips were observed in the quarters following major tremors in Taiwan, such as in 2022-Q1 and 2024-Q1, where stock price changes were -13.0% and -15.7%, respectively.\n\n\nThe plot (above) highlights the direct connection between earthquake-related events and the stock price dips. The annotations clearly mark significant earthquake events, and the stock price drops in those quarters show how external shocks like earthquakes can have a lasting impact on stock market performance, especially in sectors reliant on physical infrastructure like semiconductor manufacturing."

Visualization\n\n\nStock Price Movements\n\nCyclical Pattern: Stock movements display a cyclical pattern with 2–3 quarter intervals, hinting at delayed reactions to major news.\nSharp Rises: Sharp rises (e.g., 2020-Q3, 2024-Q1) are often followed by minor corrections, reflecting market adjustments.\nNotable Low in Mid-2022: A notable low in mid-2022 aligns with frequent earthquake mentions and fewer key product announcements, highlighting external uncertainties.\n\n\n\n\nKey Named Entities in News\n\nDominant Terms: The most frequent terms such as “Earthquake”, “Magnitude”, “Taiwan”, “Semiconductor”, and “Manufacturing” highlight earthquake concerns about regional risks.\nEmerging Themes: New themes like “$100 billion”, “Intel”, “Arizona”, and “TSMC 20,000 wafers” reflect major capital investments.\nGlobal Interest: Frequent mentions of U.S. companies (Intel, AMD), locations (Arizona, Japan), and financial figures indicate strong global interest in TSMC’s supply chain and geopolitical exposure.\n\n\n\n\nWordCloud of NER from Bing News Articles\n\n\n\n\nStrategic Terms in Earnings Calls\n\n2021-Q4: 2021-Q4 had an exceptionally high frequency (~110 mentions) of strategic terms such as N5, N4P, N3, AI, and IoT, indicating significant roadmap announcements from TSMC.\nAdvanced Processes: Increased references to advanced processes (especially N3 and N5 nodes) during these quarters correlated strongly with investor enthusiasm and stock price improvements.\nEarlier Quarters: Earlier periods (e.g., 2020-Q1/Q2) showed lower entity mentions, reflecting fewer major technological disclosures or strategic product rollouts, resulting in limited market impact.\n\n\n\nGit Log Summary"
